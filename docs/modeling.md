# Modeling Notes

## Assumptions In V1

- 2025/26 is the historical prior because it includes defensive contribution scoring.
- Historical Price Par currently uses season-end price from `players_raw.csv`; price-history curves can replace this once gameweek price snapshots are ingested.
- Sample sizes at premium prices are often thin, so curve points with low support are labelled `LOW`.
- The first backtest command is a scaffold until merged gameweek ingestion is added.

## Price Par

Market Mean is the mean viable-player production for a position and price.

Value Par is the 75th percentile viable-player production for a position and price.

The primary benchmark metric is:

```text
points_per_team_gameweek = total_points / 38
```

`points_per_90` remains a diagnostic, but does not drive squad valuation.

## Provenance

Imported rows store:

- `source`
- `fetched_at`
- `data_period`
